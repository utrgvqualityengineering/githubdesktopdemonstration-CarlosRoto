# MANE 3351 - Manufacturing Engineering Analysis

## Laboratory 6 README File

#### Assigned: October 11, 2023

#### Due: October 18, 2023 (before 3:30 pm)

#### Learning Goals

1.  Write user-defined scalar function in Python,
1.  Practice using GitHub Desktop to download and upload respositories.

#### Description

The purpose of this laboratory is the use of user-defined functions in Python.

For this lab you will write a function that evaluates the cumulative density function (CDF) of the largest extreme value distribution shown below. Unfortunately, the LaTeX used to to generate the equation for the CDF as well as the specifications for the variable and parameters will not display in GitHub and must be accessed through the [Lab Six Assignment](http://qualityengineering.utrgv.edu/MANE3351_Fall2023/LabSixAssignment).

#### Step 1

Edit the first cell (markdown), to update your personal information.

#### Step 2

In cell 2 (Python cell), define a scalar function to return a single value of $f(x)$ defined in equation 1 above when provided the values of *x*, $\mu$ and $\sigma$. The function definition should be added in cell two below the comments to add function here.

Examples of user-defined functions have been provided in most, if not all, classroom Jupyter Notebook examples. A helpful resource for this step is [How to Create User-Defined Functions in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-user-defined-functions-in-python-e5a529386534). 

#### Step 3

Also in cell 2, add three code below the function declaration that allows users to input the values for x, mu and sigma. There will be a comment in the template Jupyter Notebook where this code should be inserted. Use the Python Code from Lecture 10, October 27 as an example.

#### Step 4

Also in cell 2, add code to call your function and the the result in variable F. Print the value of variable F.

#### Step 5

Run your program and enter 1.0 for the value of *x*, 2.0 for the value of $mu$, and 5.0 for the value of *sigma*.

#### Step 6

After running and testing your program, save the Jupyter Notebook. Upload your repository using GitHub desktop.
